                                Subscribers are your loyal users. These are people who really want to get new visual content from you. They are fans interested in your products and services. Moreover, they can become your customers much faster.

                                As a rule, followers are willing to spend their precious time on you.
                                No subscribers – no target audience. Everything is simple.
                                The promotion of the page on Instagram must necessarily involve subscribers' engagement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Instagram's users are required to activate an additional channel for attracting potential customers.
                                This social network will broadcast product catalogs and descriptions if you own an online store.
                                If you have a restaurant, then Insta will be a platform for presenting new dishes, etc.
                                The main thing is to work on the content and constantly increase the number of followers.

                        <div class="desc">
                            <p>
                                We take into account many factors that affect the cost of followers in social networks.
                                Here are the main ones:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The cost of a subscriber is affected by the complexity of the topic. The simpler the subject is, the cheaper the cost of the subscriber will be.</li>
                                <li>
                                    Another factor is the difficulty of finding the TA and its interest in your product/service.
                                    It largely depends on the correctly defined TA whether they will subscribe to your Instagram and what the cost of the follower will be.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    It is important not only to identify your TA correctly but also to set up/parse the most relevant audience to exclude impressions from those who are not interested in your product/service.
                                    The higher the quality of the audience is collected, the lower the cost of the subscriber will subsequently be due to the exclusion of irrelevant impressions and an increase in the percent of conversion of the user to the follower.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    It is always better to segment and launch narrower audiences with a small reach than those with a wide reach.
                                    If you segment it correctly, you can get more and better followers and, accordingly, lower the cost of a subscriber.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The cost of a follower may also depend on the content of your Instagram. Interesting calls to action and the “Subscribe” button can often work well.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The design of your page. If your Instagram is designed correctly, the conversion of visitors to subscribers will increase.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Page content. If your Instagram is filled with interesting thematic content, users will be more willing to subscribe.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Companies attracted to increase the number of followers.
                                    Firms often work with bots that bring a minimum of benefit, but specialists like us work either only with high-quality accounts or real people.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
