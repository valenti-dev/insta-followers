                    <h3>
                        How Does it Work?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The service system is very simple – you register, choose a package of services, give your login, indicate the required number of subscribers, and pay.
                        Each package has a certain number of <b>free Instagram followers</b> and a certain cost.
                        You will see the result immediately.
                        The client makes a payment in any convenient way (bank card, cryptocurrency, electronic wallet, etc.).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The company guarantees security and confidentiality.
                        The operation is quite fast; it depends on the conditions and the package.
                        Launching story views, likes and views are almost instantaneous.
                        Attracting subscribers takes a little longer; it depends on the state of the social network algorithms.
                        Work with the client's page can only be performed with a public (open) profile with no age restrictions.
                        If your page is private (closed), working with the service is impossible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The client receives <b>free followers on Instagram</b> of two types: mixed (real people and high-quality bots) or only live subscribers.
                        The service guarantees that new members of your page will have active accounts with avatars and personal publications.
                    </p>
